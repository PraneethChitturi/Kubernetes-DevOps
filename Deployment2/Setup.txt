#Install Minikube cluster on Windows through Command Line
winget install Kubernetes.minikube

#Start your cluster through docker
#Takes time as necessary images and dependcies are installed
minikube start --driver docker
minikube status

#Minikube runs either on container or virtual machine - so need to have either Docker runtime software or VM
#Minikube has docker preinstalled to run containers in cluser
#Therefore there are 2 layers of Dockers - 1. Minikube runs as docker container; 2. Docker inside Minikube to run our application container
